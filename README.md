# MOVING FILES AUTOMATICALLY
## About
This project automatically moves all files by checking the file's extension or format, and specifically move them to a categorized folder

This project uses a library called 'watchdog'
to install: <section>pip install watchdog</section>

## Idea
*Inspired by **_Kalle Hallden's_** video:
_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbW6FRbaSl0&t=130s_
which showcase python automation ideas one of which I recreated on my own and added a few features.
